# Property Dashboard Mockup - Feature Concept

## Feature Name

Property Dashboard Mockup

## Description

A comprehensive dashboard showing multiple properties with maintenance status indicators, task completion rates, and visual progress tracking. Users can browse through sample properties and see how the monitoring system would provide complete visibility into all maintenance activities across their portfolio.

## User Value

- **Immediate Understanding**: Managers can see the "big picture" value proposition instantly
- **Portfolio Overview**: Visual demonstration of how they'd monitor 10-50 properties simultaneously
- **Status Clarity**: Clear indicators show which properties need attention vs. are up-to-date
- **Trust Building**: Shows the transparency and accountability features that solve their core problem
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Perfect for showing property owners how their investments are being managed

## Implementation Considerations

- **No Database Required**: All data will be hardcoded/mocked for demonstration
- **UI-Only Implementation**: Focus on visual design and user experience
- **Sample Data**: Create realistic property scenarios (e.g., "Oak Street Apartments", "Riverside Complex")
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded maintenance status (green=complete, yellow=pending, red=overdue)
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable properties to show detail views
- **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure dashboard works on tablets/phones for on-site managers

## Out of Scope

- Real property data integration
- Live updates or notifications
- User authentication or role management
- Actual task creation or editing
- Integration with external property management systems
- Data persistence between sessions
